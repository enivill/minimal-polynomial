# minimal-polynomial
Didactic application to determine the minimal polynomial of a matrix over R, C, Zp.

The goal of this project is the creation of a didactic application, which displays the calculation of the minimal polynomial of a matrix simply and comprehensible. The application enables the user to choose from three grades of a matrix and from four number fields. The grades of the matrix are 3, 4, 5 and the number fields are R, C, Z2 and Z3.

For the implementation we have used the programming language **Java**, the platform **JavaFX**, and the visual layout tool **Scene Builder** in the IntelliJ IDEA environment.
